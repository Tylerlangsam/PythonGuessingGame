What Is This?
-------------
This is basic Python game that allows the user to guess a random number generated by the computer. The random function is used to generate a random number. The user is then prompted to guess the number using the input prompt. If / elif / else statements are used to check user's input, and while loops allow the user to make multiple attempts as well as keep track of how many attempts it took to guess correctly. Simutaneously, we will use a function to allow the computer to guess the number.


How To Use This
---------------
1. Get started by running the python script by typing 'python guessingGame.py'
2. Guess number by following prompts in terminal until you guess correctly!
